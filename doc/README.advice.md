Like its namesake from the Emacs world, package Advice implements a generic
framework for extending the functionality of selected commands and
environments.

This package was developed as an auxiliary package of
[Memoize](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoize).  This is why it is, somewhat
unconventionally, documented alongside that package.  This applies to both the
manual and the documented code listing.
