Package CollArgs provides a command which can determine the argument scope of
any command whose argument structure conforms to
[xparse](https://ctan.org/pkg/xparse)'s argument specification.

This package was developed as an auxiliary package of
[Memoize](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoize).  This is why it is, somewhat
unconventionally, documented alongside that package.  This applies to both the
manual and the documented code listing.
