# What and why? #

Memoize is yet another package for *externalization*.  The idea is that if your
document contains code that doesn't change but takes a long time to compile,
you compile it once and reuse it in subsequent compilations.  It is common to
externalize complex TikZ pictures or Forest trees.  (Yes, I'm also the author
of Forest.)

Memoize is called as it is because the plan is to make it do more than
externalize
graphics. [Occasionally](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/16016/16819), one also
wants to "externalize" a non-graphical result of some lengthy computation, and
that's sometimes called *memoization*.  General memoization does not work in
this alpha version --- the goal here was to implement a proof of concept for
the idea described below --- but it's near the top of the todo list.

But why yet another externalization package?  PGF/TikZ contains an
externalization library, after all. (This library is documented in section 53
of the PGF/TikZ manual.)

In a single compilation, TeX can produce only a single output file, but we want
each externalized picture to reside in its own file. Externalization in TikZ
therefore requires a separate compilation for externalizing each and every
picture.  While this is not a problem if you externalize as you write, but what
happens if you're editing a 1000+ pages book and you want to externalize 200+
TikZ pictures and Forest trees? You wait for hours, that's what happens.[^1]

Enter Memoize. The basic idea is very simple. A PDF can contain multiple pages,
right?  So *why not externalize all the pictures in one go, and use them by
including a specific page from a PDF?* Pure magic: the computational complexity
drops from quadratic to linear. Or in plain English, those 5 hours turn into
(less than) 5 minutes.

# A bit of the how #

In more detail, memoization/externalization in Memoize works in two stages:

1. Everything that needs to be externalized is plopped right in the middle of a
   document --- during the normal compilation of the document.
   
2. When you compile the document again, all the externalized stuff is split off
   the main document into separate files, called *memos*. (For this to work,
   the shell escape option must be enabled.)
   
A memo is identified by the md5 sum of the code that produced it, so if you
change the code, the memo will be recompiled (in fact, a new memo will be
produced).

What can be memoized and how do we specify what should be memoized?
While PGF, TikZ and Forest can only externalize their respective products,
Memoize can externalize anything: `\memoize{<arbitrary code>}` will externalize
whatever is typeset by `<arbitrary code>`. 

Of course, we often want to memoize results of every invocation of certain
environment or command, like all the TikZ pictures and/or all Forest trees.
Memoize makes this easy: if you say `\memoizeEnableEnvironment{<environment
name>}`, all instances of this environment will be externalized --- in fact,
auto-memoization of environments `tikzpicture` and `forest` is enabled by
default, so nothing needs to be done for those but loading Memoize. 

Auto-memoization of commands is a bit more complicated than auto-memoization of
environments. It is (reasonably) clear where the end of an environment is, but
a command can take any number of arguments, it can take various kinds of
optional arguments and such.  We need to teach Memoize about the argument
structure of a command we want to auto-memoize. This can be achieved by
`\memoizeNewCommandHandler\command{<argument structure>}{<call>}`, which
defines a *command handler* we then enable by
`\memoizeInstallCommandHandler\command`. See the comments in `memoize.sty` for
details.

# What works? #

You might like the fact that TikZ `overlay`s are allowed, even though an
overlay which sticks out of the bounding box more than an inch requires (a
one-time) manual intervention by setting one or more of the `padding ...`
options.

What about `\label`--`\ref` support, you ask? Bad news first: it is not yet
implemented, because it falls under the more general issue of context
dependency (see the TODO list below), which is not yet implemented.  And the
good news: preliminary experiments show that `\label`--`\ref` more or less just
works, and this includes `\pageref`s.  This is so because the pictures are
externalized during a normal compilation.

# Different ways of doing it #

In this early version of the package, the two steps are not very flexible
yet. For example, the externalized graphics is always dumped in the middle of
your document now, but there will be an option to dump it elsewhere.  There is
already some flexibility in the second step, however. If we split off memos
using TeX, we inevitably need a separate TeX invocation to produce each memo.
--- the familiar bottleneck, even if less dramatic. To remove it, Memoize
includes a Python script (`memomanager`) which can perform the split-off step
considerably faster (from 200 * 6s to 6s), as it needs to load the document
only once.

Some other stuff is configurable as well, in particular the file structure. By
allowing you to keep the memos where you need them, Memoize can be
transparently used in complicated setups --- for example, you can (easily!) set
it up so that a compilation of an individual chapter of a book will use the
same memos as the compilation of the entire book (and vice versa).

# The future #

All this said, there's still lots of stuff to be done yet before this package
is ripe for CTAN:

* Proper documentation.  For now, I ask you to check out the examples and the
  UI section of the `.sty`.

* Context dependency, including support for `\label`--`\ref` and beamer
  overlays.  Context dependency will be implemented like in Forest (which
  features TikZ-based externalization) but with a friendlier UI.  The idea is
  to define a context, which can contain values of counters, definitions of
  macros etc., and reexternalize if that context changes.

* General memoization. At the moment, only externalization works, and even that
  is limited to externalizing a single picture per a piece of memoized code.

* Named memos (as in TikZ, see manual section 53.4.2).

* Support for further TeX engines, in particular LuaTeX.  At the moment, the
  package supports PdfTeX and XeTeX.

* Customizable workflow.  If `memomanager split` An option to remove memo pages
  from the \jobname.pdf after splitting --- no recompilation of the main
  document, but no hyperlinks either. (\pdfdraftmode and \pdflastximagepages
  will be useful here.)  option to run memomanager" from the compilation

* Customizable verbosity level.

* Testing. If you use the package, please report (github, email) any problems
  you encounter!

    * How robust is the package?  Do we ever lose any data due to a
      compilation error?  (We should not, even if the error occurs elsewhere!)
	  
	* Compatibility with other packages.

Some long-term ideas:

* Externalize in formats other than PDF.

* Support for TeX formats other than LaTeX --- in particular, Plain TeX and
  ConTeXt.
